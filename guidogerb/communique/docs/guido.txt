As an AI language model, I cannot directly convert Guido music notation into MusicXML files. However, I can guide you through the process of converting Guido notation to MusicXML using available tools.

One tool you can use to convert Guido notation to MusicXML is the Guido Engine. The Guido Engine is a C++ library that provides support for the Guido Music Notation format. It also includes an API for converting Guido notation to other formats, such as MusicXML.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with the conversion process:

Download and install the Guido Engine library:
You can download the Guido Engine library from the following link: http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/
Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

Use the Guido Engine API to convert Guido notation to MusicXML:
The Guido Engine library provides a function called GuidoGMN2MusicXML which can be used to convert Guido notation to MusicXML. Here's a simple example of how to use this function in C++:

#include "GUIDOEngine.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    // Initialize the Guido Engine
    GuidoInitDesc desc;
    desc.graphicDevice = 0;
    desc.textInfos = 0;
    GuidoInit(&desc);

    // Load the Guido notation from a file
    std::ifstream input("input.gmn");
    std::string gmn((std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(input)), std::istreambuf_iterator<char>());

    // Convert the Guido notation to MusicXML
    char *musicXML = GuidoGMN2MusicXML(gmn.c_str());

    // Write the MusicXML to a file
    std::ofstream output("output.xml");
    output << musicXML;
    output.close();

    // Cleanup
    GuidoFreeXMLString(musicXML);
    GuidoShutdown();

    return 0;
}

Replace "input.gmn" with the path to your Guido notation file, and "output.xml" with the desired output path for the MusicXML file.

Compile and run the code:
Compile the code using a C++ compiler, making sure to link against the Guido Engine library. Once compiled, run the program, and it will generate a MusicXML file from the input Guido notation.
Keep in mind that this is just one approach to convert Guido notation to MusicXML, and there may be other tools or libraries available to achieve this task. However, the Guido Engine is a powerful and widely used library for working with Guido notation.
