# Bridge Generated Applications (bridge-gapp)
This project is meant to replace the boilerplate application and configuration processes
against the current technology stack.  It uses a descriptive "Object Definition Language" (ODL)
to define the desired applications, associated data schema and related entity business logic.
The application is a marshall for "Extract, Transform and Load" (ETL) features that include 
normalization strategies against an "Object Oriented Design and Development" (OODD) approach 
significantly reducing schema real estate during transform. JDO is
leveraged, but bridge-gapp should NOT be assumed to be a JDO implementation
provider.
