			<a name="w1aab7b1">1 Introduction</a>
		</h2>

		<p>Characters in the Unicode Standard can be represented by a wide 
variety of glyphs. Occasionally the need arises in text processing to 
restrict or change the set of glyphs that are to be used to display a 
character. In special circumstances, this restriction needs to be 
expressed in plain text rather than by font selection or some other rich
 text mechanism. The Unicode Standard accommodates those circumstances 
with variation selectors: the code point of a graphic character can be 
followed by the code point of a variation selector to identify a 
restriction on the graphic character. The combination of a graphic 
character and a variation selector is known as a variation sequence (see
 Section 23.4, <em>Variation Selectors</em> of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>]).</p>
		<p>In the case of Han and other ideographs, it is impossible to build a
 single collection of variation sequences that can satisfy all the needs
 of the users. The requirements from scholars, governments and 
publishers are too different to be accommodated by a single collection. 
Instead they can be met by having multiple independent collections. The 
Ideographic Variation Database ensures that there is a single definition
 of a given variation sequence, to make interchange of text using such 
variation sequences reliable.</p>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aab9b1">2 Description</a>
		</h2>

		<p>An <em>Ideographic Variation Sequence (IVS)</em> is a sequence of 
two coded characters, the first being a character with the Ideographic 
property that is not canonically nor compatibly decomposable, the second
 being a variation selector character in the range U+E0100 to U+E01EF.</p>

		<p>A <em>glyphic subset</em> for a given character is a subset of the glyphs that are appropriate for displaying that character.</p>

		<p>The purpose of the <em>Ideographic Variation Database (IVD)</em> is to associate an IVS with a unique glyphic subset. An IVS which is present in the database is a <em>registered IVS;</em>
 one can determine reliably the intent of such IVSes when they occur in 
text by consulting the database, thus those IVSes are suitable for use 
in text interchange.</p>

		<p>IVSes are subject to the usual rules for variation sequences: 
unregistered IVSes (which are not in the database) should not be used in
 text interchange, and registered IVSes should be used only to restrict 
the rendering of their ideograph to the glyphic subset associated with 
the IVS in the database. Furthermore, variation selectors are default 
ignorable. This implies that registrants are expected to ensure that the
 glyphic subset associated with an IVS is indeed a subset of the glyphs 
which are acceptable for the base character alone. Stated another way, 
the shapes in the glyphic subset of an IVS should be unifiable with the 
base character of that IVS. One possible way to determine this, at least
 for characters with the Unified_Ideograph property, is to consider the 
unification rules for Han ideographs (see Section 18.1, <em>Han</em> of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>] and Annex S, <em>Procedure for the unification and arrangement of CJK Ideographs</em> of [<a href="#ISO10646">ISO 10646</a>]).</p>
		<p>In an effort to reduce the number of encoded variants, the 
unification rules for characters with the Unified_Ideograph property, 
when applied to the IVD, have been expanded to include the following two
 cases whose examples are shown using IDSes (<em>Ideographic Description Sequences</em>) because one of the characters in each example pair is either unencoded or not-yet-encoded:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Characters that have a different structure, but whose difference 
is not considered significant enough to encode them as separate unified 
ideographs, and for which strong evidence associating them as variants 
of encoded characters can be provided. Examples include the following:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>⿱椎十 (UAX #45 UTC-00344) versus ⿰木隼 (U+69AB 榫)</li>
				<li>⿱汨皿 (IRG Working Set 2015 #02038) versus ⿰氵昷 (U+6E29 温)</li>
				<li>⿱戠火 (IRG Working Set 2015 #02274) versus ⿹戠火 (U+243B7 𤎷)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Characters with the same structure, but with different components
 at the second (or subsequent) level that may not be generally 
unifiable, and for which strong evidence associating them as variants of
 encoded characters can be provided. Examples include the following:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>⿰月㲋 (UAX #45 UTC-01164; IRG Working Set 2015 #03444) versus ⿰月𣬉 (U+818D 膍)</li>
				<li>⿺𠃊西 (UAX #45 UK-01506; IRG Working Set 2015 #00083) versus ⿺辶西 (U+8FFA 迺)</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<p>When considering the second case, the character should be rarely 
used and not in general circulation, and the registrant is expected to 
provide evidence that demonstrates similarity of glyph shape and general
 acceptance as a variant.</p>
		<!--p class="reviewnote">Review Note: The presence of UAX #45 UTC-Source and UK-Source source references, along with IRG Working Set 2015 serial numbers when applicable, is to demonstrate that the characters in question either exist or are in the pipeline to be encoded, meaning that they are not contrived. The UAX #45 UTC-Source and UK-Source source references are stable and may remain, and if the IRG Working Set 2015 serial numbers remain as part of the examples in this specification, they are subject to change if the characters to which they correspond eventually become encoded, but otherwise do not invalidate these new unification rules.</p-->
		<p>To guarantee the stability of texts using registered IVSes, the 
association between an IVS and a glyphic subset is permanent: an IVS is 
never reassigned to another glyphic subset.</p>

		<p>While the IVD guarantees that a registered IVS corresponds to a 
single glyphic subset, and that this association is permanent, it does 
not guarantee that two different IVSes on the same ideograph have 
non-overlapping or even distinct glyphic subsets.</p>

		<p>There is no guarantee that two IVSes using the same variation 
selector but on different ideographs have any relationship, nor will a 
variation selector be designated for a purpose independently of any 
base. For example, if some IVS using U+E0100 captures a restriction on 
the display of left component of its base ideograph, some other IVS also
 using U+E0100 could capture a restriction on the display of the right 
component of its base ideograph; and therefore, the effect of U+E0100 
does not need to be uniform in all the IVSes it is part of.</p>

		<p>Should there be a requirement to register more than 240 IVSes 
involving the same ideograph, the Unicode Consortium will begin the 
process of encoding additional variation selectors, and make those 
available for registration of Ideographic Variation Sequences.</p>

		<p>To facilitate the organization and use of the IVD, registered IVSes
 are grouped in collections. This facilitates tracking the glyphic 
subset associated with an IVS, which is identified as an entry in a 
collection. It is also expected that the glyphic subsets in a given 
collection have been selected so that as an aggregate, they satisfy the 
requirements of a given user community.</p>

		<p>If there are sequences that correspond to the same glyphic subset, 
it becomes a burden for implementers, which can make a collection less 
likely to be implemented. As a result, in an effort to minimize the 
number of sequences that correspond to the same glyphic subset, 
registrants are strongly encouraged, but not required, to share 
sequences where sequences in a submission are similar to those in an 
existing collection. Furthermore, as part of the registration process, 
the registrar shall alert the registrant to the potential of sharing 
sequences. The sharing of sequences across collections may occur if 
there is mutual agreement among the registrants for the affected 
collections.</p>

		<p>Registration of a collection does not imply suitability for any 
particular purpose. The usefulness of a given variation sequence and the
 usefulness of a collection as a whole depend to a large extent on their
 use. Registrants are encouraged to describe the intent of their 
collections, and users are encouraged to evaluate whether a collection 
is useful for their purpose.</p>

		<p>Implementations are free to support any combination of registered 
sequences, including those from multiple collections or partial subsets 
of collections.</p>

		<p>While the registration process requires that variation sequences be
 described at the time they are registered, and it strongly encourages 
the registrant to continue providing public access to that description 
for as long as possible, it cannot guarantee that this will be case. 
Users of registered sequences should carefully evaluate whether the 
continuing public availability of the description is necessary for their
 purpose, and whether the registrant of the relevant sequences can 
provide it.</p>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aac11b1">3 Format of the Ideographic Variation Database</a>
		</h2>

		<p>The Ideographic Variation Database consists of two data files. The 
first, IVD_Collections.txt records the registered collections. The 
second, IVD_Sequences.txt records the registered sequences.</p>

		<p>In each file, lines starting with a '#' character and empty lines 
are comment lines. The other lines are organized into fields, separated 
by a semicolon; initial and trailing white space in those fields is not 
significant. Both files are encoded in UTF-8, using U+000A as the line 
separator. Both files must end with a comment line “# EOF”.</p>

		<p>In IVD_Collections.txt, each line corresponds to an Ideographic Variation Collection, and there are three fields per line:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>field 1: the identifier of a collection</p></li>
			<li><p>field 2: a regular expression for the identifiers within the 
collection; all such identifiers must match that regular expression. 
Over time, this regular expression may be extended, as new identifiers 
are used in the collection.</p></li>
			<li><p>field 3: the URL of a site describing the collection</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>In IVD_Sequences.txt, each line corresponds to an Ideographic Variation Sequence and there are three fields per line:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>field 1: the code points of the base character and the variation selector, separated by a space</p></li>
			<li><p>field 2: the identifier of the collection under which the sequence is registered</p></li>
			<li><p>field 3: the identifier of the sequence, provided by the 
registrant; this identifier must match the regular expression for the 
collection</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>The identifiers for collections and sequences are character strings
 starting with one of 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', and continuing with one of 
'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '_' ,'-','+'. The use of '-' and '+' in 
identifiers is allowed for the purpose of backwards compatibility with 
existing registrations. Unique programmatic identifiers can be generated
 from these identifiers by one of two means: 1) folding '-' and '+' into
 '_', or 2) removing them altogether. The regular expressions for 
identifiers conform to Perl 5.8 regular expressions [<a href="#Perl">Perl</a>].</p>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aac13b1">4 Registration Procedure</a>
		</h2>

		<p>The Ideographic Variation Database is populated by submitting 
registration requests to a registration authority. The first step is to 
register a collection. After this is done, individual glyphic subsets 
can be registered in the context of that collection.</p>

		<h3>
			<a name="w1aac13b5b1">4.1 Registration of a Collection</a>
		</h3>

		<p>The registrant must first create a web page describing the intent 
of the collection, its principles, and any other data that may be useful
 for users of the collection.</p>

		<p>Once the appropriate page is online, the intent to register the 
collection must be announced publicly in a manner designated by the 
registrar and sent to the general Unicode e-mail distribution list [<a href="#DistList">DistList</a>].
 This announcement must include the URL of the page(s) describing the 
proposed collection. This starts a review period of at least 90 days, 
during which comments and questions about the collection can be 
submitted to the registrant. The registrant should respond to these 
comments and questions.</p>

		<p>At the end of the review period, the registrant can submit the registration form in <a href="#registration_form">Appendix A</a>, together with a written and signed statement that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>the registrant will make reasonable efforts to maintain the stability of that URL and the site it points to</p></li>
			<li><p>the variation sequences that will be registered in that 
collection can be used freely, without any limitation, fee or other 
requirement</p></li>
			<li><p>all the comments and questions received during the review period have been addressed</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Upon receipt of a complete application and the applicable fee if 
any, the registrar will assign a collection identifier (respecting as 
much as possible the suggested identifier), and add the collection to 
the Ideographic Variation Database.</p>

		<p>Owners of collections can change the designated representative at 
any time by notifying the registrar. They can also change the URL of the
 web site they maintain by notifying the registrar. Ownership of a 
collection can be transferred to another party by notifying the 
registrar.</p>

		<p>The registration of sequences in that collection can be started concurrently with the registration of the collection itself.</p>

		<h3>
			<a name="w1aac13b7b1">4.2 Registration of Sequences in a Collection</a>
		</h3>

		<p>The registrant must first include the proposed sequences in the web
 page describing the collection (or some page pointing from it). This 
must include a file in the format of IVD_Sequences.txt, except that the 
first field must contain only the code point of the base character. The 
registrant is responsible for ensuring that sequence identifiers are 
unique for each base character <em>within</em> the collection, including
 sequences previously registered in that collection, and that they match
 the regular expression for sequence identifiers in the collection. An 
application that does not respect these rules will be rejected. Ideally,
 this description should include representative glyphs for proposed 
sequences.</p>

		<p>Once the page is online, the intent to register the sequences must 
be announced publicly in a manner designated by the registrar and sent 
to the general Unicode e-mail distribution list [<a href="#DistList">DistList</a>].
 This announcement must include the URL of the page(s) describing the 
proposed sequences. This starts a review period of at least 90 days, 
during which comments and questions about the sequences can be submitted
 to the registrant. The registrant should respond to these comments and 
questions.</p>

		<p>At the end of the review period, the registrant can submit the 
application for those sequences. The registrant must include one or more
 representative glyphs for each registered sequence. Independent of the 
registration process, the registrant may also supply additional 
representative glyphs for registered sequences of an existing 
collection.</p>

		<p>Upon receipt of a complete application and the applicable fee if 
any, the registrar will assign a variation selector for each variation 
sequence, and add the sequences to the Ideographic Variation Database.</p>

		<h3>
			<a name="w1aac13b9b1">4.3 Registration Authority and Registrar</a>
		</h3>

		<p>The Unicode Consortium will be the registration authority for this 
database. It will appoint a registrar to handle requests for 
registration. Collections for which the registration authority itself is
 the registrant will have no special status over other registered 
collections. Collections submitted for registration by the registration 
authority will also undergo the same vetting process as any other 
submission.</p>

		<h3>
			<a name="w1aac13c11b1">4.4 Registration Fees</a>
		</h3>

		<p>The registration authority may impose a non-refundable processing 
fee for the registration of collections and sequences. If a registration
 application is incomplete, the registrar will inform the registrant and
 accept one corrected application at no fee. Further corrections to the 
application may require an additional fee.</p>

		<p>Collections that are submitted for registration or sponsored by the registration authority are exempt from processing fees.</p>

			<a name="w1aac17b1">Appendix B. Hypothetical Example</a>
		</h2>

		<p>This appendix presents an hypothetical example, where it is 
desirable to express in plain text that the display of a character 
occurrence should be restricted.</p>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aac17b5b1">1 The Situation</a>
		</h2>

		<p>Consider the ideograph U+82A6 <em>ashi;</em> this character can be appropriately rendered by a number of different glyphs:</p>

		<center><img src="UTS%20%2337%20%20Unicode%20Ideographic%20Variation%20Database_files/u82a6.png" alt="Four different glyphs for U+82A6"></center>

		<p>In the following Japanese sentence (which means roughly “Ms. Ashida
 is a young lady from Ashiya”), this character occurs twice. The first 
occurrence could be displayed with any of those four glyphs, and it is 
therefore not necessary to express any restriction in plain text; the 
character U+82A6 alone is enough, and usual font selection mechanisms 
can take care of selecting a glyph appropriate for the context 
(typically 3 in modern Japanese). On the other hand, the second 
occurrence is in the name of the town Ashiya, and it is customarily 
displayed with an older form (4) of the character.</p>

		<center><img src="UTS%20%2337%20%20Unicode%20Ideographic%20Variation%20Database_files/sentence.png" alt="芦田さんは芦屋のお嬢様だ"></center>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aac17b7b1">2 Describing the Collection and its Content</a>
		</h2>

		<p>Assuming that some party “Example” wishes to express the 
restriction above in plain text, they would create a collection for this
 kind of situation. This collection could be targeted at the 
representation of person and place names, for example. They would put a 
description of this collection on their web site, at 
“http://www.example.com/names”, which could look like this:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>This collection of glyphic subsets is intended for the 
representation of person and place names in Japanese. Elements in this 
collection are identified by an integer (i.e. match the regular 
expression “[0-9]+”).</p>

			<p>It currently contains a single glyphic subset:</p>

			<p>Base Ideograph: U+82A6</p>

			<p>Identifier in this collection: 23</p>

			<p>Glyphic subset: there is a single horizontal stroke in the 
radical; the top stroke below the radical is attached and slanting up. 
Thus <img src="UTS%20%2337%20%20Unicode%20Ideographic%20Variation%20Database_files/u82a6-in.png" alt="glyph 4 for U+82A6"> is in the glyphic subset, and <img src="UTS%20%2337%20%20Unicode%20Ideographic%20Variation%20Database_files/u82a6-out.png" alt="glyphs 1 through 3 for U+82A6"> are not</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aac17b9b1">3 The IVD</a>
		</h2>

		<p>Assuming a successful registration, the collection could be 
assigned a name like “Example_names”; the glyphic subset 23 in that 
collection could be associated with the IVS &lt;82A6 E0134&gt;. This 
would be reflected in the IVD as follows:</p>

		<p>IVD_Collections.txt would contain one entry for this collection:</p>

		<blockquote>Example_names;[0-9]+;http://www.example.com/names</blockquote>

		<p>IVD_Sequences.txt would contain one entry for this particular glyphic subset:</p>

		<blockquote>82A6&nbsp;E0134;&nbsp;Example_names;&nbsp;23</blockquote>

		<p>Using these entries, the IVS &lt;82A6, E0134&gt; can be traced to 
entity 23 in the collection “Example_names”, and that collection can be 
traced to the web site “http://www.example.com/names”, and therefore to 
the description of the collection and its glyphic subsets.</p>

		<h2>
			<a name="w1aac17c11b1">4 Using the IVS</a>
		</h2>

		<p>Now that the IVS is registered, it can be used in plain text 
interchange. The example sentence could be represented by the character 
sequence &lt;82A6, 7530, …, 82A6, E0134, …&gt;. The first occurrence of 
U+82A6 is not followed by a variation selector, because there is no need
 to express any glyphic restriction. The second occurrence uses the 
registered variation sequence, and can be interpreted unambiguously 
using the IVD.</p>
