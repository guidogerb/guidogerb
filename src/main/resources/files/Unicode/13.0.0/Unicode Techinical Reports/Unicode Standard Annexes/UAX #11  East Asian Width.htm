  <h2>1 <a name="Overview" href="#Overview">Overview</a></h2>

  <p>When dealing with East Asian text, there is the concept of an <i>inherent</i> width of a character. This width takes on either of two values: <i>narrow</i> or <i>wide.</i>
 For traditional mixed-width East Asian legacy character sets, this 
classification into narrow and wide corresponds with few exceptions 
directly to the storage size for each character: a few narrow characters
 use a single byte per character and all other characters (usually wide)
 use two or more bytes.</p>

  <p>Layout and line breaking (to cite only two examples) in East Asian 
context show systematic variations depending on the value of this 
East_Asian_Width property. <i>Wide</i> characters behave like 
ideographs; they tend to allow line breaks after each character and 
remain upright in vertical text layout. <i>Narrow</i> characters are kept together in words or runs that are rotated sideways in vertical text layout.</p>

  <p>For a traditional East Asian <i>fixed pitch</i> font, this width 
translates to a display width of either one half or a whole unit width. A
 common name for this unit width is “Em”. While an Em is customarily the
 <i>height</i> of the letter “M”, it is the same as the unit <i>width</i>
 in East Asian fonts, because in these fonts the standard character cell
 is square. In contrast, the character width for a fixed-pitch Latin 
font like Courier is generally 3/5 of an Em.</p>
  <p>In modern practice, most alphabetic characters are rendered by 
variable-width fonts using narrow characters, even if their encoding in 
common legacy sets uses multiple bytes. In contrast, emoji characters 
were first developed through the use of extensions of legacy East Asian 
encodings, such as Shift-JIS, and in such a context they were treated as
 wide characters. While these extensions have been added to Unicode or 
mapped to standardized variation sequences, their treatment as wide 
characters has been retained, and extended for consistency with emoji 
characters that lack a legacy encoding.</p>
    
  <p>Except for a few characters, which are explicitly called out as <i>fullwidth</i> or <i>halfwidth</i>
 in the Unicode Standard, characters are not duplicated based on 
distinction in width. Some characters, such as the ideographs, are 
always wide; others are always narrow; and some can be narrow or wide, 
depending on the context. The Unicode character property <i>East_Asian_Width</i>
 provides a default classification of characters, which an 
implementation can use to decide at runtime whether to treat a character
 as narrow or wide.</p>

  <p>The East_Asian_Width property does not preserve canonical 
equivalence, because the base characters of canonical decompositions 
almost always have a different East_Asian_Width than the precomposed 
characters. Decomposing a character, and applying the East_Asian_Width 
to a base character and combining marks separately does not yield the 
expected values. For examples, see Section 4, <a href="#Definitions"><i>Definitions</i></a>.</p>

  <h2>2 <a name="Scope" href="#Scope">Scope</a></h2>

  <p>The East_Asian_Width is a normative property and provides a useful concept for implementations that</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have to interwork with East Asian legacy character encodings</li>
    <li>Support both East Asian and Western typography and line layout</li>
    <li>Need to associate fonts with unmarked text runs containing East Asian characters</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This annex gives general guidelines how to use this property. It 
does not provide rules or specifications of how this property might be 
used in font design or line layout, because, while a useful property for
 this purpose, it is only one of several character properties that would
 need to be considered. While the specific assignments of property 
values for given characters may change over time, it is generally not 
intended to reflect evolving practice for existing characters. In 
particular some alphabetic and symbol characters are treated as wide in 
certain East Asian legacy character set implementations, and as narrow 
in all other cases. Instead, the guidelines on use of this property 
should be considered recommendations based on a particular legacy 
practice that may be overridden by implementations as necessary.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The East_Asian_Width property is not intended for 
use by modern terminal emulators without appropriate tailoring on a 
case-by-case basis. Such terminal emulators need a way to resolve the 
halfwidth/fullwidth dichotomy that is necessary for such environments, 
but the East_Asian_Width property does not provide an off-the-shelf 
solution for all situations. The growing repertoire of the Unicode 
Standard has long exceeded the bounds of East Asian legacy character 
encodings, and terminal emulations often need to be customized to 
support edge cases and for changes in typographical behavior over time.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>3 <a name="Description" href="#Description">Description</a></h2>

  <p>By convention, 1/2 Em wide characters of East Asian legacy encodings are called “halfwidth” (or <i>hankaku</i> characters in Japanese); the others are called correspondingly “fullwidth” (or <i>zenkaku</i>)
 characters. Legacy encodings often use a single byte for the halfwidth 
characters and two bytes for the fullwidth characters. In the Unicode 
Standard, no such distinction is made, but understanding the distinction
 is often necessary when interchanging data with legacy systems, 
especially when fixed-size buffers are involved.</p>

  <p>Some character blocks in the compatibility zone contain characters 
that are explicitly marked “halfwidth” and “fullwidth” in their 
character name, but for all other characters the width property must be 
implicitly derived. Some characters behave differently in an East Asian 
context than in a non-East Asian context. Their default width property 
is considered ambiguous and needs to be resolved into an actual width 
property based on context.</p>

  <p>The Unicode Character Database [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>] assigns to each Unicode character as its default width property one of six values: <i>Ambiguous, Fullwidth, Halfwidth, Narrow, Wide</i>, or <i>Neutral</i> (<i>= Not East Asian</i>). For any given operation, these six default property values resolve into only two property values, <i>narrow </i>and <i>wide, </i>depending on context.</p>

  <h2>4 <a name="Definitions" href="#Definitions">Definitions</a></h2>

  <p><i>All terms not defined here shall be as defined elsewhere in the Unicode Standard.</i></p>

  <p><i><b><a name="ED1" href="#ED1">ED1</a>.</b> East_Asian_Width</i>: 
In the context of interoperating with East Asian legacy character 
encodings and implementing East Asian typography, East_Asian_Width is a 
categorization of character. It can take on two abstract values, <i>narrow</i> and <i>wide</i>.</p>

  <p>In legacy implementations, there is often a corresponding 
difference in encoding length (one or two bytes) as well as a difference
 in displayed width. However, the <i>actual</i> display width of a glyph
 is given by the font and may be further adjusted by layout. An 
important class of fixed-width legacy fonts contains glyphs of just two 
widths, with the wider glyphs twice as wide as the narrower glyphs.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For convenience, the classification further distinguishes between explicitly and implicitly wide and narrow characters.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><i><b><a name="ED2" href="#ED2">ED2</a>.</b> East Asian Fullwidth (F)</i>: All characters that are defined as Fullwidth in the Unicode Standard [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
 by having a compatibility decomposition of type &lt;wide&gt; to 
characters elsewhere in the Unicode Standard that are implicitly narrow 
but unmarked.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><b>Note:</b> The Unicode property value aliases drop the common prefix East Asian for this and the following property values.</p>
	</blockquote>

  <p><i><b><a name="ED3" href="#ED3">ED3</a>.</b> East Asian Halfwidth (H)</i>:
 All characters that are explicitly defined as Halfwidth in the Unicode 
Standard by having a compatibility decomposition of type &lt;narrow&gt; 
to characters elsewhere in the Unicode Standard that are implicitly wide
 but unmarked, plus U+20A9 ₩ WON SIGN.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Unlike U+00A5 ¥ YEN SIGN, U+20A9 ₩ WON SIGN has an explicit East Asian Width property of <i>East Asian Halfwidth</i>
 (H). What makes U+00A5 different is that this character was included in
 a very common—and non–East Asian—character set standard, specifically 
ISO/IEC 8859-1, and encoded at 0xA5. Almost all legacy Latin fonts 
supported ISO/IEC 8859-1 in its entirety, using variable-width glyphs. 
By contrast, most legacy font implementations used an explicit 
half-width glyph for the won sign, whose source is the standard KS X 
1003, and encoded at 0x5C. The assignment of the <i>East Asian Halfwidth</i>
 (H) property does not preclude font developers from using a 
variable-width glyph for U+20A9, and doing so has become a common 
practice.</p>
	</blockquote>

  <p><i><b><a name="ED4" href="#ED4">ED4</a>.</b> East Asian Wide (W)</i>: All other characters that are <i>always</i>
 wide. These characters occur only in the context of East Asian 
typography where they are wide characters (such as the Unified Han 
Ideographs or Squared Katakana Symbols). This category includes 
characters that have explicit halfwidth counterparts, along with 
characters that have the [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>] property <i>Emoji_Presentation</i>, with the exception of characters that have the [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>] property <i>Regional_Indicator</i></p><p>

  </p><p><i><b><a name="ED5" href="#ED5">ED5</a>.</b> East Asian Narrow (Na)</i>: All other characters that are <i>always</i>
 narrow and&nbsp;have explicit fullwidth or wide counterparts. These 
characters are implicitly narrow in East Asian typography and legacy 
character sets because they have explicit fullwidth or wide 
counterparts. All of ASCII is an example of East Asian Narrow 
characters.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is useful to distinguish characters explicitly defined as 
halfwidth from other narrow characters. In particular, halfwidth 
punctuation behaves in some important ways like ideographic punctuation,
 and knowing a character is a halfwidth character can aid in font 
selection when binding a font to unstyled text.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><i><b><a name="ED6" href="#ED6">ED6</a>.</b> East Asian Ambiguous (A)</i>:
 All characters that can be sometimes wide and sometimes narrow. 
Ambiguous characters require additional information not contained in the
 character code to further resolve their width.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Ambiguous characters occur in East Asian legacy character sets as <i>wide</i> characters, but as <i>narrow</i>
 (i.e., normal-width) characters in non-East Asian usage. (Examples are 
the basic Greek and Cyrillic alphabet found in East Asian character 
sets, but also some of the mathematical symbols.) Private-use characters
 are considered ambiguous by default, because additional information is 
required to know whether they should be treated as wide or narrow.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When they are treated as <i>wide</i> characters, ambiguous characters would typically be rendered upright in vertical text runs.</p>
    <p>Because East Asian legacy character sets do not always include 
complete case pairs of Latin characters, two members of a case pair may 
have different East_Asian_Width properties:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>Ambiguous: 	01D4    LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH CARON
Neutral:	01D3    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U WITH CARON</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Canonical equivalents of ambiguous characters may not be	
ambiguous themselves. For example, U+212B Å ANGSTROM SIGN is Ambiguous, 
while its decomposition, U+00C5 Å LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING 
ABOVE, is Neutral.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><i><b><a name="ED7" href="#ED7">ED7</a>.</b> Neutral (Not East Asian)</i>:
 All other characters. Neutral characters do not occur in legacy East 
Asian character sets. By extension, they also do not occur in East Asian
 typography. For example, there is no traditional Japanese way of 
typesetting Devanagari. Canonical equivalents of narrow and neutral 
characters may not themselves be narrow or neutral respectively. For 
example, U+00C5 Å LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE is Neutral, but
 its decomposition starts with a Narrow character.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Strictly speaking, it makes no sense to talk of narrow and wide 
for neutral characters, but because for all practical purposes they 
behave like Na, they are treated as narrow characters (the same as Na) 
under the recommendations below.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In a broad sense, <i>wide characters</i> include W, F, and A (when in East Asian context), and <i>narrow characters</i> include N, Na, H, and A (when not in East Asian context).</p>

  <h3>4.1 <a name="Relation" href="#Relation">Relation to the Terms “Fullwidth” and “Halfwidth”</a></h3>
  <p>When converting a DBCS mixed-width encoding to and from Unicode, 
the fullwidth characters in such a mixed-width encoding are mapped to 
the fullwidth compatibility characters in the FFxx block, whereas the 
corresponding halfwidth characters are mapped to ordinary Unicode 
characters (for example, ASCII in U+0021..U+007E, plus a few other 
scattered characters).</p>
  <p>In the context of interoperability with DBCS character encodings, 
this restricted set of Unicode characters in the General Scripts area 
can be construed as halfwidth, rather than fullwidth. (This applies only
 to the restricted set of characters that can be paired with the 
fullwidth compatibility characters.)</p>

  <p>In the context of interoperability with DBCS character encodings, 
all other Unicode characters that are not explicitly marked as halfwidth
 can be construed as fullwidth.</p>

  <p>In any other context, Unicode characters not explicitly marked as 
being either fullwidth or halfwidth compatibility forms are neither 
halfwidth nor fullwidth.</p>

  <p>Seen in this light, the “halfwidth” and “fullwidth” properties are 
not unitary character properties in the same sense as “space” or 
“combining” or “alphabetic.” They are, instead, relational properties of
 a pair of characters, one of which is explicitly encoded as a halfwidth
 or fullwidth form for compatibility in mapping to DBCS mixed-width 
character encodings.</p>

  <p>What is “fullwidth” by default today could in theory become 
“halfwidth” tomorrow by the introduction of another character on the 
SBCS part of a mixed-width code page somewhere, requiring the 
introduction of another fullwidth compatibility character to complete 
the mapping. However, because the single byte part of mixed-width 
character sets is limited, there are not going to be many candidates and
 neither the Unicode Technical Committee [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UTC">UTC</a>] nor WG2 has any intention to encode additional compatibility characters for this purpose.</p>

  <h3>4.2 <a name="Ambiguous" href="#Ambiguous">Ambiguous Characters</a></h3>

  <p>Ambiguous width characters are all those characters that can occur 
as fullwidth characters in any of a number of East Asian legacy 
character encodings. They have a “resolved” width of either narrow or 
wide depending on the context of their use. If they are not used in the 
context of the specific legacy encoding to which they belong, their 
width resolves to narrow. Otherwise, it resolves to fullwidth or 
halfwidth. The term <i>context</i> as used here includes extra 
information such as explicit markup, knowledge of the source code page, 
font information, or language and script identification. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Greek characters resolve to narrow when used with a standard Greek font, because there is no East Asian legacy context.</li>
    <li>Private-use character codes and the replacement character have 
ambiguous width, because they may stand in for characters of any width.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous quotation marks are generally resolved to wide when 
they enclose and are adjacent to a wide character, and to narrow 
otherwise.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The East_Asian_Width property does not preserve canonical 
equivalence, because the base characters of canonical decompositions 
almost always have a different East_Asian_Width than the precomposed 
characters. East Asian Width is designed for use with legacy character 
sets so the property value is not designed to respect canonical 
equivalence.</p>

  <p><i><b>Modern Rendering Practice.</b></i> Modern practice is 
evolving toward rendering ever more of the ambiguous characters with 
proportionally spaced, narrow forms that rotate with the direction of 
writing, making a distinction within the legacy character set. In other 
words, context information beyond the choice of font or source character
 set is employed to resolve the width of the character. This annex does 
not attempt to track such changes in practice; therefore, the set of 
characters with mappings to legacy character sets that have been 
assigned ambiguous width constitute a superset of the set of such 
characters that may be rendered as wide characters in a given context. 
In particular, an application might find it useful to treat characters 
from alphabetic scripts as narrow by default. Conversely, many of the 
symbols in the Unicode Standard have no mappings to legacy character 
sets, yet they may be rendered as “wide” characters if they appear in an
 East Asian context. An implementation might therefore elect to treat 
them as ambiguous even though they are classified as <i>neutral</i> here.</p>

  <h2>5 <a name="Recommendations" href="#Recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>
  <p><i>When mapping Unicode to East Asian legacy character encodings</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide Unicode characters <i>always</i> map to fullwidth characters.</li>
    <li>Narrow (and neutral) Unicode characters <i>always</i> map to halfwidth characters.</li>
    <li>Halfwidth Unicode characters <i>always</i> map to halfwidth characters.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous Unicode characters <i>always</i> map to fullwidth characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>When mapping Unicode to non-East Asian legacy character encodings</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide Unicode characters <i>do not</i> map to <i>non</i>-East Asian legacy character encodings.</li>
    <li>Narrow (and neutral) Unicode characters <i>always</i> map to regular (narrow) characters.</li>
    <li>Halfwidth Unicode characters <i>do not</i> map.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous Unicode characters <i>always</i> map to regular (narrow) characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>When processing or displaying data</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide characters behave like ideographs in important ways, such 
as layout. Except for certain punctuation characters, they are not 
rotated when appearing in vertical text runs. In fixed-pitch fonts, they
 take up one Em of space.</li>
    <li>Halfwidth characters behave like ideographs in some ways, 
however, they are rotated like narrow characters when appearing in 
vertical text runs. In fixed-pitch fonts, they take up 1/2 Em of space.</li>
    <li>Narrow characters behave like Western characters, for example, 
in line breaking. They are rotated sideways, when appearing in vertical 
text. In fixed-pitch East Asian fonts, they take up 1/2 Em of space, but
 in rendering, a non-East Asian, proportional font is often substituted.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous characters behave like wide or narrow characters 
depending on the context (language tag, script identification, 
associated font, source of data, or explicit markup; all can provide the
 context). If the context cannot be established reliably, they should be
 treated as narrow characters by default.</li>
    <li>[<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>] <i>emoji presentation sequences</i> behave as though they were <i>East Asian Wide</i>, regardless of their assigned East_Asian_Width property value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6 <a name="Classifications" href="#Classifications">Classifications</a></h2>

  <p>The classifications presented here are based on the most widely 
used mixed-width legacy character sets in use in East Asia as of this 
writing. In particular, the assignments of the Neutral or Ambiguous 
categories depend on the contents of these character sets. For example, 
an implementation that knows <i>a priori</i> that it needs to interchange data <i>only</i>
 with the Japanese Shift-JIS character set, but not with other East 
Asian character sets, could reduce the number of characters in the 
Ambiguous classification to those actually encoded in Shift-JIS. 
Alternatively, such a reduction could be done implicitly at runtime in 
the context of interoperating with Shift-JIS fonts or data sources. 
Conversely, if additional character sets are created and widely adopted 
for legacy purposes, more characters would need to be classified as 
ambiguous.</p>

  <h3>6.1 <a name="Unassigned" href="#Unassigned">Unassigned and Private-Use Characters</a></h3>

  <p>All private-use characters are by default classified as Ambiguous, because their definition depends on context.</p>

  <p>Unassigned code points in ranges intended for CJK ideographs are classified as Wide. Those ranges are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the CJK Unified Ideographs block, 4E00..9FFF</li>
    <li>the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A block, 3400..4DBF</li>
    <li>the CJK Compatibility Ideographs block, F900..FAFF</li>
    <li>the Supplementary Ideographic Plane, 20000..2FFFF</li>
    <li>the Tertiary Ideographic Plane, 30000..3FFFF</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All other unassigned code points are by default classified as Neutral.</p> 

  <p>For additional recommendations for handling the default property value for unassigned characters, see <i>Section 5.3</i>,<i> Unknown and Missing Characters,</i> in [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

  <h3>6.2 <a name="Combining" href="#Combining">Combining Marks</a></h3>

  <p>Combining marks have been classified and are given a property 
assignment based on their typical applicability. For example, combining 
marks typically applied to characters of class <strong>N</strong>, <strong>Na</strong>, or <strong>W</strong> are classified as <strong>A</strong>. Combining marks for purely non-East Asian scripts are marked as <strong>N</strong>, and nonspacing marks used only with wide characters are given a <strong>W</strong>.
 Even more so than for other characters, the East_Asian_Width property 
for combining marks is not the same as their display width.</p>

  <p>In particular, nonspacing marks do not possess actual advance 
width. Therefore, even when displaying combining marks, the 
East_Asian_Width property cannot be related to the advance width of 
these characters. However, it can be useful in determining the encoding 
length in a legacy encoding, or the choice of font for the range of 
characters including that nonspacing mark. The width of the glyph image 
of a nonspacing mark should always be chosen as the appropriate one for 
the width of the base character.</p>

  <h3>6.3 <a name="DataFile" href="#DataFile">Data File</a></h3>

  <p>The East_Asian_Width classification of all Unicode characters is listed in the file EastAsianWidth.txt [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Data11">Data11</a>] in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character Database</a> [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UCD">UCD</a>].
 This is a tab-delimited, two-column, plain text file, with code 
position and East_Asian_Width designator. A comment at the end of each 
line indicates the character name. Ideographic, Hangul, Surrogate, and 
Private Use ranges are collapsed by giving a range in the first column.</p>

  <h3>6.4 <a name="Adding" href="#Adding">Adding Characters</a></h3>

  <p>As more characters are added to the Unicode Standard, or if 
additional character sets are created and widely adopted for legacy 
purposes, the assignment of East_Asian_Width may be changed for some 
characters. Implementations should not make any assumptions to the 
contrary. The sets of Narrow, Fullwidth, and Halfwidth characters are 
fixed for all practical purposes. New characters for most scripts will 
be Neutral characters; however, characters for East Asian scripts using 
wide characters will be classified as Wide. Symbol characters that are, 
or are expected to be, used both as wide characters in East Asian usage 
and as narrow characters in non-East Asian usage will be classified 
Ambiguous.</p>
