			<h2>1 <a name="Section1" href="#Section1">Introduction</a></h2>
							<p>This annex describes a subset of IRG U-source ideographs as used by the <a href="http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/">Ideographic Research Group (IRG)</a>
 in its CJK ideograph unification work. The IRG is a subgroup of ISO/IEC
 JTC1/SC2/WG2 and has the formal responsibility of developing extensions
 to the encoded repertoires of unified CJK ideographs. The IRG consists 
of members of ISO/IEC contributors and liaison organizations, including 
many East Asian countries and the USA. The Unicode Consortium 
participates in this group as a liaison member of ISO.
							Each time the IRG begins the process of preparing a new CJK 
Unified Ideographs extension, IRG members submit a set of characters for
 potential inclusion in that extension. The IRG classifies these into 
sources, one for each submitter, e.g., the J-source for Japan, the 
V-source for Vietnam.</p>
							<p>The IRG U-source consists primarily of submissions from the 
Unicode Technical Committee (UTC).
							These include characters submitted by the UTC on behalf of the 
United Kingdom.
							The IRG U-source also includes characters encoded because they 
were originally submitted to the IRG by some other member body. Some of 
these are characters which were submitted <em>to</em> the UTC for consideration but were not submitted <em>by</em>
 the UTC to the IRG. (The IRG refers to such cases as “horizontal 
extensions.”) Others were left without a formal IRG source by changes 
made by the IRG in its source-mappings; these were “adopted” by the UTC 
as explained below.</p>

							<p>Each character in the IRG U-source has an identifier which 
consists of two or three letters (the prefix) followed by a hyphen and 
five decimal digits. The prefixes currently used are listed below. </p>

							<p>This UAX provides a formal reference to U-source ideographs, 
so that they may be referred to in other documents by their U-source 
identifiers.
							In many instances, it also provides a public record of ideographs
 which were submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee for 
consideration.</p>
							<p>The U-source database consists of four classes of CJK ideograph:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Ideographs which have been
								submitted to the UTC as potential candidates for
								encoding. Note that not all such ideographs are
								actually suitable for encoding as a CJK Unified Ideograph. Those that are
								not have a status of "W".</li>
								<li>Placeholder ideographs required to maintain continuity of 
U-source indices. Early versions of the U-source database allowed for 
the possibility of ideographs being withdrawn, generally because they 
had been added erroneously. Replacement ideographs were added in their 
place to keep any U-source index from being skipped. All such ideographs
 have a status of "W". (Ideographs are no longer withdrawn from the 
U-source database after they have been added.)</li>
								<li>Placeholder ideographs required to provide encoded CJK 
Unified Ideographs with IRG source information. All CJK Unified 
Ideographs in ISO/IEC10646 are required to have at least one source 
identifier. Changes to IRG source information, however, can leave a 
given ideograph without any such sources. In such cases, the ideograph 
is included in the U-source database to guarantee it has at least one 
source.  Such ideographs are indicated by a source prefix of "UCI" 
instead of "UTC".
								Further changes to IRG source information may restore 
non-U-source sources or provide new ones for such ideographs. In such 
cases, the ideograph retains the "UCI" prefix, but the encoded character
 loses its kIRG_USource reference in the Unihan database and ISO/IEC 
10646. This practice is no longer followed and the "UCI" prefix is now 
obsolete.</li>
								<li>Ideographs submitted by the UK to the IRG via the UTC for Working Set 2015. These
								ideographs are included to provide a standard, stable source
								reference for IRG purposes. Such ideographs are indicated by a
								source prefix of "UK" instead of "UTC". UK-submitted characters are no longer submitted
								through the UTC. No further characters with the "UK" prefix will
								be added. For more information about these ideographs, please see <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/uk-source-ideographs/">https://github.com/unicode-org/uk-source-ideographs/</a>.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The actual U-source data are found in three additional files:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>[<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Glyphs45">Glyphs45</a>],
 a PDF showing the glyphs for the U-source ideographs.  This document is
 a simple matrix with the representative glyph for a U-source ideograph 
and its identifier in each cell. The representative glyphs used are 
drawn in a modern style, such as is used by the IRG in its work.  The 
use of modern forms for some characters originally drawn in a seal style
 should not be taken as implying any mechanism for the inclusion of seal
 forms as a whole in [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</li>
								<li>[<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#RSChart45">RSChart45</a>], a PDF providing a radical-stroke chart for U-source ideographs. These charts use the glyphs found in the main glyph chart.</li>
								<li>[<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Data45">Data45</a>], a text file containing information regarding the ideographs. A detailed description of this file follows.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>2 <a name="Section2" href="#Section2">Text File Data</a></h2>The text file consists of UTF-8 text. Each line consists of eight fields separated by semicolons.<ol>
								<li>The ideograph's U-source identifier. This consists of the 
letters "UTC", "UK", or "UCI", followed by a hyphen and five decimal 
digits, starting with 00001. Identifier numbers are not skipped, and are
 not reused. Identifier numbers are assigned sequentially.
								Ideographs whose prefix is "UTC" are either those submitted to 
the UTC for consideration or those included in the U-source database for
 placeholder purposes. Ideographs included to guarantee an IRG source 
reference have the prefix "UCI".</li>
								<li>A string indicating the ideograph's current status. These are described below.</li>
								<li>A Unicode code point. This field is generally empty. Its 
interpretation depends on the character’s status and is documented 
below.</li>
								<li>A radical-stroke index for the ideograph, as described in [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</li>
								<li>A KangXi dictionary index for the ideograph, as described in [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</li>
								<li>An ideographic description sequence (IDS) for the ideograph, if one can be generated.</li>
								<li>A string indicating the ideograph's source and an optional index within the source.</li>
								<li>General comments regarding the ideograph.</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>2.1 <a name="Section21" href="#Section21">The Status Field</a></h3>
							<p>The status field reflects the ideograph's current status. The 
value of this field can change over time. The possible values are A, B, 
C, Comp, D, E, F, G, N, U, V, W, X, UK-2015, WS-2017, and strings 
matching the regular expressions "UTC-\d{5}", "UCI-\d{5}", and UK-\d{5}.
 New values may be added in the future and existing values removed.</p>

							<p>A status of Comp means that the ideograph is encoded in 
Unicode as a compatibility ideograph. The value of the ideograph's IDS 
field is IDEOGRAPHIC VARIATION INDICATOR (U+303E) followed by
							the ideograph of which it is a compatibility variant. For 
example, UTC-00932 is encoded as U+FA26, which is a compatibility 
variant of U+90FD. UTC-00932 therefore has the
							IDS field value 〾都 (U+303E U+90FD).</p>

							<p>A status of V means that the ideograph is a variant of a 
character encoded in Unicode. These variants are not limited to 
z-variants. Other variants include glyphs with components rearranged 
(for
							example UTC-00344, which rearranges the components of U+69AB but 
is pronounced the same and means the same), simplified versions of 
encoded characters (for
							example UTC-00842), and ideographs which mean the same and are 
pronounced the same as encoded ideographs and have a sufficiently 
similar shape as to be easily mistaken for one another (for
							example UTC-00399). This is a deliberately less strict, if 
somewhat more subjective, standard than is used for unification work.</p>

							<p>A status of W means that the ideograph is not suitable for encoding as a CJK Unified Ideograph. An example here is UTC-00326,
							which is a nonce form specifically coined for use with Figure 18-9, <em>Using the Ideographic Description Characters</em>, in
							[<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
 and to fill an empty slot in the U-source database.
							While the character does have an intended meaning ("frog at the 
bottom of a well"), it isn't suitable for encoding because
							of its <em>ad hoc</em> nature and lack of generalized use. 
							The bulk of the characters with a status of W are Wenlin-specific
 z-variants which should be represented (if at all), via a variation 
sequence defined by Wenlin, not by the UTC.</p>

							<h3>2.2 <a name="Section22" href="#Section22">The Source Field</a></h3>
							<p>The source field consists of source information, which 
consists of a source tag usually followed by a source-specific index 
string. Source tags and indices are separated by a space, and multiple 
source indices are separated by commas. Multiple sources are separated 
by asterisks.  </p>
							<p>Note that the sources listed here may not provide adequate 
evidence of use for IRG work. This is partly because
							characters listed here may not be suitable candidates for 
encoding, but also because IRG requirements for evidence have become
							increasingly stringent over time. Many of the characters in each 
of the sets encoded prior to Extension D do not have adequate evidence 
of use
							by current IRG standards.</p>
			<p>The source tag may be a URI, in which case the index string is the
 date (year-month-day) when the URI was accessed. The source tag may 
also be a U-source index for cases where an ideograph was added to the 
U-source twice. The source tags beginning with a lowercase k correspond 
to fields within the Unihan database. Please consult [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>] for information on these sources and the format and meaning of the index strings.</p>
			<p>The remaining sources are listed below. The left column contains 
the source tag. The center column contains bibliographic information for
 the source.
			The third column contains a description of source index, if any. The 
description frequently includes a regular expression which the index 
matches; see [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41/tr41-26.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>] for more information.</p>

							<h3>2.3 <a name="Section23" href="#Section23">The Comments Field</a></h3>
							<p>The comments field is a general-purpose, unstructured field. 
It is generally empty. It can contain any Unicode character other than 
tabs, semicolons, and any line-break character. The purpose of this 
field is to provide any additional relevant information for an ideograph
 which is not included in any other fields. For example:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>The comment field for UTC-00119 indicates why it is inappropriate for encoding</li>
								<li>The comment field for UTC-00595 clarifies its variation relationship to other characters</li>
								<li>The comment field for UTC-02981 contains a kMandarin value pending encoding</li>
