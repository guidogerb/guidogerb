This is research and development reducing the bigdata footprint.

A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the entities in a
communication network.

Objects in the MIB are defined using a subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
called "Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)" RFC 2578.
This software performs the parsing, and is an MIB compiler.

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard and flexible notation that describes
data structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data.
It provides a set of formal rules for describing the structure of objects that are
independent of machine-specific encoding techniques and is a precise, formal notation
that removes ambiguities.

The MIB hierarchy can be depicted as a tree with a nameless root, the levels of which
are assigned by different organizations. The top-level MIB OIDs belong to different
standards organizations, while lower-level object IDs are allocated by associated
organizations. This model permits management across all layers of the OSI reference model,
extending into applications such as databases, email, and the Java reference model,
as MIBs can be defined for all such area-specific information and operations.

There are a large number of MIBs defined by standards organizations like the IETF,
private enterprises and other entities. This project is an attempt to standardize the
streaming of character sets in a compressed blocks, Object IDs, representing object
identifiers allocated according to the rules specified in ASN.1 with bounded
precision in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
